# Here, as in library/lists/constructors/words, we assume words in a list are separated by the item '0'. append_word takes in two lists, 'z_' and 'cons x_ y_', and returns the first list as a word on the end of the second list.

# Examples
# append_word (cons 4 nil) (cons 5 (cons 6 nil)) = cons 5 (cons 6 (cons 0 (cons 4 nil)))
# append_word (cons 7 (cons 8 nil)) nil = cons 0 (cons 7 (cons 8 nil))
